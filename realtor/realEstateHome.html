    <h2><span lang="en-ca">Customer Reviews</span></h2>
	<p>This will be the MOST HONEST REVIEW you will ever read. I currently live here for about a year and I truly wish someone had told me these things before I sign the lease.
        First of all, they will tell you what you want to hear, and show you what you want to see to rent you the place. And I am telling you, once you move in, there are no end to the skeletons in their closets. They misrepresent everything from start to end.
        The worst part is that they have the laziest, least caring, management ever. So, you are pretty much in a sink or swim situation with your hands and feet are tied together.
        You are paying premium to live in this building, but you aren't getting premium services of all the other buildings in the area.
        Please note that their security is not 24/7. In an area like this, a 24/7 security is very important. We actually have had strangers just sleep in the lobby a few times.
        We have had packages and deliveries stolen from the lobby many times, and if not stolen, not delivered properly, because there wasn't a security guard.</p>
